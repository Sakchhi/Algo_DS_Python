# Abstract Data Types

## Terms
- Algorithm
- **Data type** -- given type along with a collection of operations for manipulating values of the given type
    - Simple data types
    - Complex data types - Multiple components consisting of simple types or other complex types, *eg strings, lists, objects, dictionaries, etc*
    - User-defined types
- **Abstraction** -- Mechanism for separating the properties of an object and restricting the focus to those relevant in the current context
    - **Procedural Abstraction** -- Use of a function or method knowing what it does but ignoring how it's accompalished
    - **Data abstraction** -- Separation of the properties of a data type (its values and operations) from the implementation of that data type
