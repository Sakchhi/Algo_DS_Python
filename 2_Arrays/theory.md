# Array Structure
- Multiple sequential elements
- Stored in contiguous bytes of memory
- Allows random access to individual elements by subscript
- Arrays vs List
    - Array has limited operations like creation, reading, writing; List has large number of operations
    - Array remains fixed in size, List size can change as elements are added and deleted
